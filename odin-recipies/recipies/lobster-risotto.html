      <li>Pour in white wine and let it simmer until it is absorbed by the rice.</li>
      <li>Gradually add hot chicken stock to the pan, stirring constantly until the rice absorbs the liquid.</li>
      <li>Continue adding stock and stirring until the rice is cooked al dente.</li>
      <li>Stir in the chopped lobster meat and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the lobster is heated through.</li>
      <li>Finish the risotto by stirring in grated Parmesan cheese and a knob of butter for extra creaminess</li>

    <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To extract maximum flavor from the lobster shells, simmer them in the chicken stock before using it in the risotto.</li>
      <li>Make sure to stir the risotto constantly to prevent it from sticking to the pan and to achieve a creamy texture.</li>
      <li>If you prefer a more intense lobster flavor, you can add a small amount of lobster stock or lobster base to the risotto.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Storage and Serving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Leftover lobster risotto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li>
      <li>Reheat the risotto gently in a pan with a splash of chicken stock or water to maintain its creamy texture.</li>
      <li>Serve the lobster risotto as a main course with a side salad or as a side dish with grilled seafood or steak.</li>
    </ul>
