    <p>One bite of Gordon Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding and I was hooked! It was truly love-at-first-bite! Now, you can skip the fancy restaurant and enjoy this insanely delicious copycat recipe at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Medjool Dates: The base of this dessert, dates provide natural sweetness and a rich, sticky texture. I got mine from Costco! Look for the ones in a 2-pound plastic tub.</li>
      <li>All-purpose Flour: The primary dry ingredient that forms the base of the batter.</li>
      <li>Baking Soda: Helps soften the dates during cooking and contributes to the light, tender texture of the pudding.</li>
      <li>Baking Powder: Helps the pudding rise and become fluffy.</li>
      <li>Dark Brown Sugar: Used for caramelizing and adding deep molasses-like sweetness. Light brown sugar works well, or coconut sugar for a healthier swap.</li>
      <li>Butter: Adds richness and flavor to the pudding and sauce. You can use margarine or plant-based butter as a substitute.</li>
      <li>Egg: Provide structure and moisture to the pudding.</li>
      <li>Vanilla Extract: Enhances the flavor of the pudding.</li>
      <li>Salt: Balances the sweetness and enhances the overall flavor of the dessert.</li>
      <li>Heavy Cream: Essential for creating the rich toffee sauce. Substitute with coconut cream for a dairy-free version.</li>
      <li>Bourbon (optional)</li>
      <li>Speculoos Cookie Butter Ice Cream or Vanilla Ice Cream</li>
      <li>Lotus Biscoff Cookie crumbs (if not using Speculoos Cookie Butter ice cream)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Date Pudding Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Begin by soaking dates in 1 cup of boiling water until they're warm.</li>
      <li>Blend the soaked dates into a smooth puree.</li>
      <li>Sift together dry ingredients, including all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.</li>
      <li>Cream together brown sugar and butter until smooth.</li>
      <li>Combine the dry and wet ingredients, adding the pureed dates last.</li>
      <li>Prepare your baking tins by greasing them with butter then dust each with flour.</li>
      <li>Tap out any excess flour.</li>
      <li>Fill each tin with batter, ensuring they're about Â¾ full.</li>
      <li>Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 25-30 minutes, adjusting the time based on the size of your tins.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sticky Toffee Sauce</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1: Combine all spices into a large bowl and combine thoroughly with mixture</li>
      <li>Now comes the fun part! Drizzle that warm delicious sticky toffee sauce all over your pudding. Let it cascade down the sides, creating a decadent pool of saucy goodness.</li>
      <li>Channel your inner Gordon Ramsay (or keep it classic) with a scoop of ice cream on top. Speculoos ice cream adds a warm, spiced kick, but vanilla is always a safe and delicious choice.</li>
      <li>Optionally, garnish with toppings such as Lotus Biscoff cookies, nuts, or sprinkles, or enjoy it without any toppings, staying true to the classic Sticky Toffee Pudding style!</li>
    </ol>
