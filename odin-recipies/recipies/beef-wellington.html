    <p>Want to know how to make a Beef-Wellington just like they do in Hell's Kitchen? Here's how.</p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb filet mignon</li>
      <li>1 lb mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 large shallot</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 tbsps olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tbsps Grey Poupon</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package puff pastry flour, to dust</li>
      <li>2 egg yoks, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tspns basil</li>
      <li>2 tspns thyme</li>
      <li>1 dash sea salt, to taste</li>
      <li>1 dash pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Directions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>heat olive oil in a frying pan.</li>
      <li>season fillet with garlic powder, basil, salt & pepper.</li>
      <li>sear on all sides for 25 seconds. (you dont want to cook it at this stage, just color it.).</li>
      <li>remove fillet from the pan and leave to cool.</li>
      <li>put the mushrooms, shallots & garlic in a food processor with thyme, salt & pepper -- pulse to a rough paste.</li>
      <li>scrape the mixture into the same pan and cook over high heat for 10-15 minutes, tossing frequently, to cook out all of the moisture from the mushrooms. spread out on a plate to cool.</li>
      <li>brush the fillet with mustard.</li>
      <li>preheat the oven to 400.</li>
      <li>lay a sheet of cling wrap on a work surface and arrange the procuitto slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows.</li>
      <li>spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared fillet in the middle.</li>
      <li>spread more mushroom paste on top of the fillet and top with the remaining procuitto.</li>
      <li>using the cling wrap, neatly roll the procuitto and mushrooms around the fillet and twist the ends to secure. chill for 15 minutes to allow the fillet to set and keep its shape.</li>
      <li>roll out puff pastry on a floured surface til the thickness of a penny and brush with egg yolk.</li>
      <li>remove the plastic wrap from the beef and lay in the center.</li>
      <li>fold the ends over and then wrap the fillet in pastry, cutting off any excess. turn over so the seam is on the bottom and place on a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>brush all over with egg yolk and chill for 15 minutes to let the pastry rest.</li>
      <li>lightly score the pastry in 3 places and glaze again with egg yolk.</li>
      <li>bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 350 and cook another 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
      <li>the beef should still be slightly pink in the center.</li>
    </ol>
