Gordon's Hellthy Dishes
A three page website featuring some of the most favorited dishes from Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen Restaurant.

Reflection:
This project for the most part was very simple for me as I am already pretty well-versed in HTML. I did however make a mistake that cost me 2 hours trying to figure out what was wrong when it was a simple coding error. I was putting all of my "Unordered Lists" items inside their own UL tag instead of creating the main UL tag and then listing each item as an LI list Item. It initially caught my eye because Prettier was separating each UL tag onto different lines, so I mistakenly started thinking the issue was with Prettier not formatting the code correctly, so I endlessly searched Google for how to fix it. I spent more time looking at google than my code, and then when I looked at the code I realized my mistake. Safe to say, I will not make that mistake again, so even though I am pretty good already in HTML, this was a great exercise to just reinforce the basics. I went a little bit over and above what was requested in this project by linking to an external styles sheet and creating a class for my images, I also put my images and styles sheet in their own folders as well to keep everything clean.
